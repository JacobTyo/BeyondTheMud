This repository is forked from https://github.com/mxin262/SwinTextSpotter 

All experiments can be ran using the file at `projects/SWINTS/train_net.py`, 
accompanied with any of the config files in `projects/SWINTS/configs/` that start with `perph`. 
To run with the Reading Between the Mud dataset, download the dataset at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OSiKxY1V7AK1czaKfl5t_hXIcamZo6dj/view?usp=drive_link
and then place the extracted files at the root of this repository. The raw and preprocessed files are present, so the system will be ready to run.
